# Curriculum Vitae

## Description
Welcome to our Spring Boot project! This application is a fun and simple way to get hands-on experience with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. Thymeleaf is an awesome Java-based templating engine that we utilize for server-side rendering of our web pages.

What's the coolest part? When you pair Thymeleaf with Spring Boot, it automatically configures Spring MVC for you. Pretty neat, isn't it?

In this project, we breathe life into our HTML pages using Thymeleaf, showcasing data straight from the database. We've also shown how to craft components as items and dynamically include them in the main page, resulting in a full list of these items being rendered.

Please keep in mind, this application is not designed for production environments. It's purely a fun and exploratory way to learn Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

Looking ahead, I plan to further develop this project by incorporating more exciting technologies such as Angular for front-end development, microservices, DevOps pipelines, the Elastic Stack, and even artificial intelligence.

So, dive in and enjoy exploring!
